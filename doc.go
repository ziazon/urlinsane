Package urlinsane implements typosquatting functions

CLI

	urlinsane google.com
    urlinsane google.com -t CO
    urlinsane google.com -t CO -k en2


Example


    package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"github.com/rangertaha/urlinsane"
	)

	func main() {

		conf := urlinsane.BasicConfig{
			Domains:     []string{"google.com"},
			Keyboards:   []string{"en1"},
			Typos:       []string{"co"},
			Funcs:       []string{"ip"},
			Concurrency: 50,
			Format:      "text",
			Verbose:     false,
		}

		urli := urlinsane.New(conf.Config())

		out := urli.Execute()

		for r := range out {
			fmt.Println(r.Live, r.Domain.Domain, r.Typo.Name, r.Data)
		}

	}



### Design

![alt text](design.png "Design Overview")

* Configuration via CLI options.
* Generating typo options to be consumed by workers
* Executing typosquatting algorithm workers concurrently. Defaults to 50 workers at a time.
* Executing extra functions workers on typos to add additional information to the results. Each extra fuc
* Output results in text, json and csv formats.
